# EMFcamp schedule API tools

Various things related to ingesting, manipulating and otherwise using the [EMFcamp schedule API](https://developer.emfcamp.org/schedule).

Includes:

- A Rust client library
- A CLI
- An adapter that sits between the official API, adding some nice development features and fixing the fucky timestamps
- A tool to send event announcements via MQTT

Still very much a work in progress, and very much subject to change until the 2024 schedule API is a thing.
